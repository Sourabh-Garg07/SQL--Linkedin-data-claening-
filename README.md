# SQL--Linkedin-data-claening-

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing LinkedIn job postings data using MySQL. The dataset contained various inconsistencies such as null values, duplicates, wrong formats and other standardizing issues. The goal was to ensure data quality and prepare the dataset for further analysis.

DATA CLEANING STEPS

Handling Null Values:

Identified columns with null values.
Populate data in the nulls where applicable
Dropped columns with null values where required.

# Removing Duplicates:

Detected and removed duplicate rows to ensure data uniqueness.

# Text Cleaning:

Removed non-eligible characters to maintain database compatibility.
Standardized text formats by trimming whitespace and other irrelevant characters.
Replaced special characters (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, commas, ?) with blank spaces for consistency.

# Data Type Adjustments:

Converted data types to appropriate formats for better database performance and compatibility.

# Additional Cleaning:
Removed irrelevant columns which were not useful for analysis.

# Tools and Technologies

MySQL: Used for executing SQL queries to clean and preprocess the data.
SQL Queries: Employed various SQL functions and commands to handle data inconsistencies.

# Conclusion

The cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis and can be used to derive meaningful insights about job postings on LinkedIn. This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning in ensuring data quality and reliability.
